\section{Introduction}
Industrial control system (ICS) is the technology used to automate the manufacturing process. It is responsible for controlling and managing large number of field devices. The manufacturing industry has seen an astronomical rise in the adoption of ICS in recent years. The fierce competition among the companies has been the main catalyst for this revolution in the manufacturing industry. According to the study report published by  Market Research Future (MRFR), the industrial control system market will be growing even more in the future \cite{c1}. A lot of these industrial control system are deployed in critical infrastructures such as the smart grid, health care system, water purification, nuclear plants. As a result, any kind of security breach and attack can have significant impact on human lives as well as be very costly. Securing these system has become a priority as a result of the increasing number of attacks in these domain.
